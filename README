
#INITIALIZE
Make sure you have Node installed. 
Have Postgres ready.

#Create a config file
This should look like:
Please call this config.json in the root directory.
'''{
    "user": "postgres",
    "host": "localhost",
    "database": "guestbook",
    "password": "password123",
    "port": "5432"
}'''

#Creating the DB
Run 'npm run initDB'- should say 'success' on success

#Running the program
Run 'npm start'
Navitage to localhost:3000/index


#VULNERABILITIES
1) SQL INJECTION

Choose anything for the username.
In the Post body, try: maru', current_timestamp); DROP TABLE post; -- 
There is a space at the end after -- .
This should drop the table. 


2) CROSS-SITE SCRIPTING
In the post body, try:
<script>alert("wassup")</script>
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>
An alert should pop up. If it doesn't, try refreshing because there's a race condition
where you get redirected before the query completes.
